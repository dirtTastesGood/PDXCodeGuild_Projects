        <p>&emsp;Alan Watts was a British philosopher who interpreted and popularised Eastern philosophy for a Western audience. In his many years as a skilled author and orator, he published over twenty books and recorded
            hundreds of hours of lectures exploring the nature of consciousness and existance.
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;Watts was born in 1915 in what is now Southeast London. His family lived in pastoral surroundings and Watts, an only child, grew up playing brookside, learning the names of wildflowers and butterflies. Probably because of the influence of his mother's religious family, an interest in "ultimate things" soon seeped in. It mixed with Watts's own interests in storybook fables and romantic tales of the mysterious Far East.
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;In his teens he spent his spare time at the London Buddhist Lodge, where he became the secretary at age sixteen. After secondary school, he was primarily an autodidact. His involvement at the Lodge afforded him a lot of opportunity for personal growth and connected him with many eminent spiritual leaders and theosophists. 
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;At the age of twenty-one he attended the World Congress of Faiths at the University of London, where he met the esteemed Zen Buddhist scolar, D.T. Suzuki. This spurred a budding interest in Zen into an outright fascination. He referred to Zen as the "synthesis of Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism after 700 CE in China."
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;In 1945 at age thirty, feeling the need to find a vocational outlet for his philosophical inclinations, he worked to obtain a master's degree in theology and became an Episcopal priest in Evanston, Illnois. However, resigned from the ministry five years later, finding himself unable to reconcile his Buddhist beliefs with formal doctrine of the church.
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;Shortly thereafter, he moved to California and joined the faculty at American Academy of Asian Studies, where he taught from 1951 to 1957, when he published one of his best known books, The Way of Zen. After leaving the academy, he toured parts of Europe, where he met Swiss philosopher, Carl Jung. Returning to San Francisco, he moved his focus back to his radio and television programs in Berkeley and to his talks and seminars. 
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;He spent his later years living at his cabin in Druid Heights, California where he continued exploring child development, the arts, cuisine, education, law and freedom, architecture, sexuality, and the uses and abuses of technology. He wrote and published books until his death in 1973.
